  3. **Surveillance Systems**: CCTV cameras, motion sensors.
  4. **Environmental Design**: Strategic lighting, landscaping.
  5. **Intrusion Detection Systems**: Infrared sensors, glass-break detectors.
  6. **Security Personnel**: Guards, patrols, K-9 units.
  7. **Alarm Systems**: Fire alarms, panic buttons.
  8. **Physical Barriers**: Turnstiles, reinforced doors.
  9. **Secure Storage**: Safes, vaults.
  10. **Redundancy and Backup Systems**: Backup power supplies, redundant communication lines.

### **2. Key Laws and Regulations in Cybersecurity and Physical Security**
This section highlights legal frameworks that guide organizations in protecting data, ensuring privacy, and mitigating security risks.
